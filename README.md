# Spectra_convolution_plot
This repository contains Python tools for generating, convoluting, and plotting absorption spectra from theoretical (computational) and experimental data.   It automatically detects data units (eV or nm), applies broadening functions (Gaussian/Lorentzian), and generates comparative plots between Vibronic, Computed (Stick), and Experimental spectra.
